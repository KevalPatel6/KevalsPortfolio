            <p>I was born and raised in Philadelphia, PA where I currently reside. Previously, I have worked as a Business Analyst on various healthcare related projects. However, more recently, I have rerouted my career to pursue Software Development. I am currently enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania Full-Time Coding Bootcamp where I am mastering an understanding of the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In the future, I will have learned not only mastered front-end development, but also gained a mastery of back-end engineering. My goals after this bootcamp is to work as a Software Engineer helping prospective employers deploy meaningful websites for their organization. In my downtime, I am avid sports fan that partakes in a variety of sports but most notably Tennis and Golf.</p>
