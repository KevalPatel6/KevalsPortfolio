# KevalsPortfolio
This is Keval's Portfolio as a prospective Software Developer


Webpage: https://kevalpatel6.github.io/KevalsPortfolio/

Description
This repository is Kevals Portfolio for Challenge 2. This project was undertaken in order to create a webpage that highlights my work for prospective employers and to demonstrate my understanding of creating a webpage from scratch and using grid within CSS to make the HTML elements easier to style within the page. This solves the problem of whether or not I have any experience with HTML and CSS to create webpages. I learned how to use CSS grid to make the layout that I desired and worked with media screen to change what happens when the window sizes were changed. 

Usage

As a user you can navigate the page using the navigation links to go to the appropriate section. Below you can see a screen shot of the navigation bar links. 

<a href="./assets/ReadMe-Nav.PNG" rel = "screenshot of webpage with nav bar in a red box">

When navigating to the Work section you can find two projects. One includes the HTML-CSS refactor application. A second, includes a password generator that is coming soon. If you hover over the image for each project they will be highlighted. If you click the image of the first application then you will be redirected to the application itself. The password generator is still in progress and does not link to anything just yet.
